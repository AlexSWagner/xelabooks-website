            <h1>Privacy Policy for XelaBooks</h1>
            <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: June 29, 2025</p>
            
            <p>This privacy policy applies to the XelaBooks mobile application (hereby referred to as "Application") created by Alexander Wagner (hereby referred to as "Service Provider").</p>

            <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
            <p>For a better experience while using the Application, the Service Provider may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The types of information collected by the Application include:</p>

            <h3>User Provided Information:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your Email Address and a unique Firebase User ID.</li>
                <li><strong>Library Data:</strong> To enable cloud synchronization, we store information about your library, such as which audiobooks you have imported and your listening progress, in our secure database.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Automatically Collected Information:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> This may include your device's Internet Protocol (IP) address, device manufacturer and model, the version of the Android operating system you are using, the pages of the Application you visit, the time and date of your visit, and the time spent on those pages.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The Service Provider may use the information you provided to contact you from time to time to provide important information, required notices, and, with your consent, marketing promotions.</p>

            <h2>Data Usage and Connectivity</h2>
            <p>Audiobooks are large files and downloading them can consume a significant amount of mobile data. To protect users from unexpected data charges, the Application defaults to allowing downloads on Wi-Fi only. This setting can be changed by the user at any time in the Application's settings menu to allow downloads over a mobile data connection.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Services and Data Access</h2>
            <p>The Application utilizes third-party services to provide its features. These services have their own privacy policies regarding how they handle data. The Service Provider may share your information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.</p>

            <p>The Application uses the following third-party services:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Firebase:</strong> For user authentication (Firebase Authentication), cloud library synchronization (Cloud Firestore), application analytics (Google Analytics for Firebase), and crash reporting (Firebase Crashlytics). <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy Policy</a></li>
                <li><strong>Google Play Services:</strong> For core application functionality on Android. <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
                <li><strong>Google Drive API:</strong> To allow users to browse and import audiobook files from their personal Google Drive account. The Application only accesses files and folders you explicitly select.</li>
                <li><strong>Microsoft OneDrive:</strong> To allow users to browse and import audiobook files from their personal OneDrive account. The Application only accesses files and folders you explicitly select. <a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement" target="_blank">Microsoft Privacy Statement</a></li>
                <li><strong>Book Information Services:</strong> To enhance your library with high-quality cover art and descriptions, the Application sends book titles or metadata to the following services:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Google Books API</li>
                        <li>Open Library API</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Internet Archive:</strong> To allow searching and downloading of public domain audiobooks.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Third-Party Content</h2>
            <p>The Internet Archive is a third-party service that provides access to a vast collection of public domain content. The Service Provider is not responsible for the content, accuracy, legality, or nature of any material that users choose to download from the Internet Archive through the Application.</p>

            <h2>Data Retention, Opt-Out, and Deletion Rights</h2>
            <p>You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling it.</p>
            <p>The Service Provider will retain User Provided Data for as long as you use the Application and for a reasonable time thereafter. The Application provides an in-app "Delete Account" feature. Using this feature will initiate a process to permanently delete your account information (Email, Firebase User ID) and all associated cloud library data from our databases.</p>
            <p>If you have any issues or would like to request data deletion manually, please contact us at <a href="mailto:alex@xelafy.com">alex@xelafy.com</a>, and we will respond in a reasonable time.</p>

            <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>The Service Provider does not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us so that we will be able to take the necessary actions.</p>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information and employs physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the information we process and maintain.</p>

            <h2>Changes</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.</p>

            <h2>Your Consent</h2>
            <p>By using the Application, you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us.</p>

            <h2>Contact Us</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, please contact the Service Provider via email at <a href="mailto:alex@xelafy.com">alex@xelafy.com</a>.</p>
