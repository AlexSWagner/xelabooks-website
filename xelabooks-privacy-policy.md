This privacy policy applies to the XelaBooks mobile application (hereby referred to as "Application") created by Alexander Wagner (hereby referred to as "Service Provider").

For a better experience while using the Application, the Service Provider may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The types of information collected by the Application include:
•	User Provided Information:
o	Account Information: When you create an account, we collect your Email Address and a unique Firebase User ID.

Data Usage and Connectivity
Audiobooks are large files and downloading them can consume a significant amount of mobile data. To protect users from unexpected data charges, the Application defaults to allowing downloads on Wi-Fi only. This setting can be changed by the user at any time in the Application's settings menu to allow downloads over a mobile data connection.
Third-Party Services and Data Access
The Application utilizes third-party services to provide its features. These services have their own privacy policies regarding how they handle data. The Service Provider may share your information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.
The Application uses the following third-party services:
•	Firebase: For user authentication (Firebase Authentication), cloud library synchronization (Cloud Firestore), application analytics (Google Analytics for Firebase), and crash reporting (Firebase Crashlytics). Firebase Privacy Policy

Third-Party Content
